# Welcome to Project Astra

Project Astra is our finance app.

### Getting Started

Once you have the repo set up on your machine, run `npm install` 
to install all dependencies. If you've never seen this command before,
you probably have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Once you've successfully installed all dependencies, run 
`npm start` to start development. This will trigger a tab to 
open in your default browser. Whenever you save changes in the 
directory, no matter the file, it will re-compile your JS into 
something most browsers can understand, and also trigger a refresh
in your browser tab. Leave this running in the background as you 
write code. 

### Adding a component

To add a component, create a `ComponentName.js` and `ComponentName.css` in `src/components`.
